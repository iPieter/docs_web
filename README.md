# docs_web
A personal project: building a intuitive and cross-platform multi-user document editor.

## Structure
The online version is split into a few small sized parts, each managing a specific goal:
1. The base: this is the core of the project, it manages the title, headings and paragaphs. 
2. Images: this part handles everyhing about images, including captions
3. Math: if a user needs some math, this part handles it. It will use LATEX.
4. Tables: I don't think this needs more explanation.
5. Chemistry: This could be combined with the Math-module, but for a more streamlined experience I think it should be separated.

Feel free to fork at any time, I don't know what I'm doing either. ;-)
